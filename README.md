## Lab 2
1.	Add 2 16-bit numbers. The 16 bit numbers are stored into the data segment.
2.	Add 2 32-bit numbers stored in the data segment.
3.	Program to multiply two unsigned 16-bit numbers.
4.	 Program to multiply signed 16-bit numbers.
5.	 Program to divide a 16-bit unsigned/signed number by 16-bit number. The numbers are stored into the data segment.
6.	Program to copy an array of bytes/words from the variable “SOURCE” to variable “DEST” which are defined in data segment.
7.	To sum an array of numbers stored in the data segment.
8.	Program to separate even and odd numbers from an array of words.

## Lab 3
1. Write a program to find the smallest number in an array of words and store it in the variable named small of the data segment.
2. Write a program to sort an array of signed numbers given in the data segment.
3. Write a program to find the square root of a given number.
4. Consider an array(array1) of  20 random numbers ranging between 1 to 4. Write a program to Count the number of 1’s, 2’s, 3’s and 4’s in the array1 and store the result of the count in one more array(array 2) of size 4 elements. At first location of array2 it has to store the count of 1’s, at second location it has to store count of 2’s and so on...

## Lab 4
1.	Write a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 to 50.
2.	Write a program to read a string of lower case letters and convert to upper case and display the string on the console.
3.	Write a program to create a file and write 10 bytes of data into the file. Create one more file and make a copy of the first file.(i.e Read from the first file and write into the second file.)
4.	Write a program to display the string “Hello world” when the character ‘Y’ is pressed.  

## Lab 5
1.	Write the programs to verify the instructions AAA, AAS, AAM, AAD, DAA and DAS instructions.
2.	Implement the above instructions. The program should behave in the similar manner without using the above mentioned instructions.
3.	Implement a calculator for single digit numbers, which takes the input through the keyboard and display the result on the screen.

## Lab 6
1.	Write a program to concatenate two strings STR1 and STR2 and store the result in the string STR3.
2.	Write an assembly language to count the number of occurrence of a substring in a given string.
3.	In a string “Good Morning”, write a program to replace the substring “Morning” with “Evening” and display “Good Evening”.
4.	Program to enter two strings, Find the characters that match in both the strings, store these characters

## Lab 7
1. Write a program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number.Display appropriate message.
2. Write a program to check whether two strings are the same irrespective of their case.
3. Write a Program to check whether the input string is palindrome or not. Get the string through the user.
4. Write a program to search an element from a sorted list using binary search.

## Lab 8
1. Write an assembly language to convert the code of a 4 digit BCD number to hexadecimal and viceversa.
2. Write an assembly language to convert ASCII to 7 segment display.
3. Write an assembly program to convert an 8 bit BCD number to  corresponding octal number.

## Lab 9
1.	Write an assembly language to find the LCM of two numbers.
(Pass the parameters to the procedure using registers, pointers and stack)
2.	Write an assembly language to divide a 32 bit number by 16 nit number. The program should handle the quotient size exceeds 16 bits.

## Lab 10
1.	Convert 8 bit binary number to gray code.
2.	Convert temp From Fahrenheit to Celsius. [(F − 32) × 5/9 = °C]
3.	Write a program to find the 2’s comp of a 16 bit number.

## Lab 11
1.	Write an assembly language to handle the divide by zero interrupt.
2.	Write an assembly language to override the overflow interrupt.
3.	Write an assembly language program to find the factorial recursively and find the nCr.

## Lab 12
1.	Write an assembly language to perform addition,sub,mul and div of two floating point/Integer numbers and verify the result.
2.	Write an assembly language to find the area of a circle.
3.	Write an assembly language to find the side of a right angled triangle.
